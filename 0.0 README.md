# krakegg_stage01
Krakegg is a soft robotics end effector exploring the implementation of bionic actuation for soft robotics grippers. The repository is documenting the first stage of development. 

The repository contains the files, code & hardware components used in the first prototype of the project. 

In the documents, you will find: 



A. Text instructions: 

0.Concept & process: explaining the overall process leading to the development of the Stage 1 Prototype for the soft robotics gripper. 

0_01: Bill of materials: a list of the materials used for the production for the Stage 1 Prototype, with affiliated links to similar products that can be purchased from Amazon/ local retailers. 

0_02: Build process: documenting the steps taken in order to build the Stage 1 Prototype



B. 3D printing files: 

01_Krakegg Stage 01- Moulds_Baked (...): Rhino file of the specific moulds used for the production of the prototype

01_Krakegg Stage 01: Moulds_Parametric (...) : Grasshopper file of the parametrized moulds, in order to quickly change the parameters and generate new 3D printing-ready files 

02_Krakegg Stage 01- Connection to robot arm (...): Rhino file of the current iteration of the connection plate, air chamber and finger holder to the plate



C. Circuit: 

03_Krakegg Stage 01- Circuit: zipped folder containing hardware circuit information, including wiring instructions

03_Krakegg Stage 01- Arduino code: .ino file containing the current iteration of Arduino code
